This calculator project allows users to calculate basic mathematical equations using either the on-screen buttons or the keyboard. It is also possible to change the color scheme of the calculator to one of four options, pink, blue, green, and yellow. 
I hope you enjoy the calculator project and I'm excited to continue forward in The Odin Project!
